# cubit_bloc_poc

A Flutter project to demonstrate the usage bloc package and to make it easy to implement the BLoC Design Pattern (Business Logic Component).

A Cubit is class which extends BlocBase and can be extended to manage any type of state. Cubit requires an initial state which will be the state before emit has been called. The current state of a cubit can be accessed via the state getter and the state of the cubit can be updated by calling emit with a new state.
